Congratulations! You've now set up Minnie for your authentication.

If you're just starting out, here's a few more things you can do:

  1. Set up your User model using email/password authentication.  Just run the
     following:

       bundle exec rails generate minnie:install:user

     That will configure an existing User model or generate a new one if you
     don't have one yet.

  2. Ensure you have defined root_url to *something* in your config/routes.rb.
     For example:

       root to: "home#index"

  3. Ensure you have flash messages in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.
     For example:

       <p class="notice"><%= notice %></p>
       <p class="alert"><%= alert %></p>
